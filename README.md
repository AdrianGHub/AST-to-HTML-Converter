# Practice project "Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)"

> Imagine this scenerio. There is this time in in your working team when you're trying to figurying out how to make HTML<->AST converter, built in order to handle object representation of HTML, applicable with the framework configuration. One person from your team has written the first part of this converter, which converts HTML to AST. You're responsible for reverse this process.

> Create module which exports function convertASTToString. As a parameter function should take object representation of HTML fraction (Abstract Syntax Tree). Output should returns fraction of the HTML converted to string.
